| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| First | Significantly improved on the core gameplay by adding features such as the ability to shoot as asteroids, sound effects, several levels of increasing difficulty, better player movement, animation and explosions (or other cool stuff). Use of advanced features of Processing that we haven't covered in the class. For example, PShape, classes, pushMatrix and popMatrix |
| 2.1 | Used functions, arrays, loops, variables and implemented everything in the video |
| 2.2 | Got the core game implemented but missing some features such as the splash screen or the game over screen. Didn't use functions and instead everything in the draw function |
| Pass | Got some basic stuff like the player and asteroids working but no collisions |
| Fail | Very little works |

# Assignment 1

Create an animated Christmas card in Processing. You must make the Christmas card for someone and give it to that person. 
Here are some examples of previous assignments that students have done:

In your Christmas card you should use:

- Procedural drawing (no sprites!)
- Variables
- The if statement
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays
- Any other cool stuff you have taught yourself in Processing

Rubric:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Animation, loops, arrays and methods used extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Some complex interactivity such as a game or generative system. Use of keyboard, mouse or controller input. Music and fonts. Use of some advanced features of P5 we haven't covered in class such as classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code|
| 2.1 | Lots of animation, loops and arrays. Functions. Also using audio and fonts. Little or no interactivity. Between 100 and 200 lines of code |
| 2.2 | No animation or simple back and forth type animation, use of loops, but no arrays. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code|
| Pass | No animation. No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesn't work. 20-50 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |
