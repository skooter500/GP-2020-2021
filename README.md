### Semester 1 

# Week 3 - Using variables and trigonometric functions
- [Trigonometry problem set](https://1.cdn.edl.io/IDqRlI8C9dRkoqehbbdHBrcGT6m87gkCQuMKTkp0U7JvHvuG.pdf)

## Lab
### Learning Outcomes
- Use numeric variables in a sketch
- Use operatorts on variables
- Use trigonometry
- Make beautiful things

A person flying a kite has released 176m of string. The string makes an angle of 27Â° with the ground. How high is the kite? How far away is the kite horizontally?
Write a p5 sketch to draw and solve the problem.
  - Solve the problem on paper first
  - Make variables for stringLen, theta, kHeight, kDist and any other variables you need
  - Assign the values that you know to the variables
  - Write code to calculate the kith height and horizontal distance values
  - Write code to draw the scenario

You can use the function [text](https://processing.org/reference/text_.html) to print text to the screen and [nf](https://processing.org/reference/nf_.html) to format a number to a certain number of dp's. For example ```text("Price: " + nf(p, 10, 2), 10, 50)```. You can look these functions up in the Processing reference.

### Part 2 - Spiral Jam

Experiment with the spirals sketch and see what kind of crazy beautiful spirals you can make. Use variables for colour gradients, use different shapes etc etc.


# Week 2 - Using variables
### Learning Outcomes
- Practice drawing
- Learn how to use operators with variables

# Part 1

Here is a youtube video of 4 sketches you can program today:

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kPOFqXsLLeo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPOFqXsLLeo)

In your solution use the following processing functions:
- fill
- rect
- ellipse
- background
- stroke
- noStroke

And the mouseX and mouseY varibles. You can also use the + - * / operators

# Part 2

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/uvPVGiU-bn4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvPVGiU-bn4)

What is happening:

- The ground takes up half the window size
- The spaceship is 100 pixels wide and is *centered* around the mouse position.
- The person starts at the right side of the screen and moved from right to left

Use variables wherever practical in your sketch and calculate positions and sizes relative to these variables.

Bonus!

There are few things you can try (but you will probably have to read ahead and figure out how the if statement works)

- Come up with a more beautiful looking spaceship and person
- Change the colours of everything
- Make a car that drives from left to right
- When the person reaches the left side of the screen, he should switch direction
- Make the lights on the spaceship flash different colours
